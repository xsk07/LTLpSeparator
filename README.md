# Study and implementation of algorithms based on the Separation Theorem for applications on finite traces in the field of process mining

#An algorithm for the separation of Linear Temporal Logic formulas into a conjunction of pure past, pure present and pure future ones.
It is based on the Gabbay Separation Theorem and Linear Temporal Logic formulas equivalences.
